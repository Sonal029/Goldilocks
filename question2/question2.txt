Explaination:

To solve this problem I first created a txt file which had comma seperated values, Using buffered Reader, I read all the lines and using buffered writer I tried writing the values in the "write.txt" file.
While reading every value I also added up the values in a varible sum and at lat appended the value to the write file at the end.
I also checked for exception if he code throws any.
